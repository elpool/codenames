Clone of the popular board game optimized for playing across video chat.

The host of the game should share their screen showing the game board.
Click the "copy clue-giver" button to copy a URL that can be sent to the 
clue-giver for each team (don't let other players see this url). This url
will reveal which words belong to the red or blue team. 

When a team makes a guess, the host should just click on the word 
to automatically reveal the word's color.

To help avoid confusion:
- The text boxes on the left and right for each team let you list the names of each player so everyone knows which team their on.
- You can also fill in the "current clue" box at the top so people don't have to keep asking what the clue is.
